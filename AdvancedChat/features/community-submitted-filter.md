#### Key Settings Explained

* **enabled**: Activates the vulgar words filter on your server, ensuring real-time moderation of chat content.
* **swear-words-database**: Specifies the URL to a JSON file hosted on GitHub, containing the list of community-submitted vulgar words. This database is a live resource, regularly updated by contributors.
* **disabledChannels**: Specifies the channels where swearing is allowed.
* **swear-message**: Defines the message that is sent to a player immediately after they use a word or expression listed in the database, urging them not to swear.
* **obfuscate**: When set to `true`, any detected swear words in a player's message are replaced with asterisks, censoring the inappropriate language. If `false`, the original message is suppressed entirely, and not sent.
* **action**: Outlines the consequences for swearing on the server. In this case, the player is warned, and staff are alerted about the incident, including the message content.
