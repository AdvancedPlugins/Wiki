# Oraxen

Using Oraxen is extremely easy with AdvancedChat! Oraxen explains this more in-depth on their wiki page here: [https://docs.oraxen.com/configuration/glyphs#whats-my-glyph-placeholder](https://docs.oraxen.com/configuration/glyphs#whats-my-glyph-placeholder)

## Placeholders

Using the example from Oraxen documentation, the section name is the glyph id. In this example the glyph id is `heart`, the placeholder is `%oraxen_glyphid%`, so in this example: `%oraxen_heart%` would turn into a heart emoji from Oraxen.

You are required to use PlaceholderAPI plugin for this. To learn how to install it, check out our [first-install.md](../../first-install.md "mention") guide.

## Using as a prefix

To use the graphics as prefixes, you can read our [prefix-guide.md](../../guides/prefix-guide.md "mention")to learn more!
