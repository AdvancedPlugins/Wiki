# Factions

Using Factions plugins together with AdvancedChat is easy! You are required to use PlaceholderAPI plugin for this integration. To learn how to install it, check out our [first-install.md](../../first-install.md "mention") guide.

## Placeholders

Most Factions plugins' placeholders will be listed here: [https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders#factionsuuid](https://github.com/PlaceholderAPI/PlaceholderAPI/wiki/Placeholders#factionsuuid) in case you cannot find them, contact the developers or read their wiki - everyone has them posted!

## Using as a prefix

In this example, we are using FactionsUUID plugin. Their placeholder for player's faction is `%factionsuuid_faction_name%.`

To use the Factions placeholders in prefix, you can read our [prefix-guide.md](../../guides/prefix-guide.md "mention")to learn more!
