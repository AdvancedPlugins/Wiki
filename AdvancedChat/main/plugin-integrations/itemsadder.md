# ItemsAdder

Using ItemsAdder custom graphics inside AdvancedChat is extremely easy! ItemsAdder explains this more in-depth in their wiki here: [https://itemsadder.devs.beer/plugin-usage/placeholderapi](https://itemsadder.devs.beer/plugin-usage/placeholderapi)

## Add to Chat, Prefix

#### FontImage (emoji etc) <a href="#fontimage-emoji-etc" id="fontimage-emoji-etc"></a>

This is the code: `%img_NAME%` instead of `NAME` write the font\_image name. For example: `%img_smile%` would turn into a smile emoji that you have configured with ItemsAdder

You are required to use PlaceholderAPI plugin for this. To learn how to install it, check out our [first-install.md](../../first-install.md "mention") guide.
