# üåê Using With Networks

## **Overview**&#x20;

This guide explains how to implement the AdvancedChat plugin across network servers like BungeeCord and Velocity.

## **Setup Instructions**

1. **Do Not Install on Proxy**: AdvancedChat should not be installed directly on the proxy server itself (BungeeCord or Velocity).
2. **Installation on Each Server**: Instead, install AdvancedChat on each server that is part of the network. This includes all Minecraft servers connected through the network proxy.

That is all! Now your private messages using `/msg` command and channels that utilized `crossServer` setting will be synchronized and global between all servers!
