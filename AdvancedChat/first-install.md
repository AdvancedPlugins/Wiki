### Step 1 - Installing the plugin <a href="#step-1-installing-the-plugin" id="step-1-installing-the-plugin"></a>

1. Stop the server.
2. Make sure your server version is supported - they are listed here [https://advancedplugins.net/item/AdvancedChat.188](https://advancedplugins.net/item/AdvancedChat.188) We recommend using PaperMC or any other paper forks - special optimizations have been implemented with paper due to their improved world processing.
3. Add AdvancedChat.jar plugin file to your server/plugins/ folder
4. **Recommended, optional.** Add **PlaceholderAPI.jar** plugin file to your server, this will greatly enhance the functionality of AdvancedChat and placeholders. You can find the plugin here: [https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245/)
5. **Optional.** Add **ProtocolLib.jar** plugin file to your server to enable **Chat Text Customizer**. Put the file in your `server/plugins/` folder (ProtocolLib for latest MC versions available here: [https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/](https://ci.dmulloy2.net/job/ProtocolLib/))
6. Start the server.
