# Triggers

Triggers are the events that will activate an ability. Examples of triggers include a player attacking another player, a mob taking damage, they can be environmental events, or a block being broken. Triggers can also have their own parameters, such as a specific type of damage or a certain block material.

Triggers are events that activate abilities in the system. When a trigger occurs, the system checks for any abilities that are set to activate on that trigger and performs the corresponding effects.
